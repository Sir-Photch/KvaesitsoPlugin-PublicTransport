# Public transport plugin for Kvaesitso

This plugin enables querying your local public transport providers for stops and departures near you, while using your favorite launcher app [Kvaesitso](https://github.com/MM2-0/Kvaesitso).
It is a thin wrapper around [schildbach/public-transport-enabler](https://github.com/schildbach/public-transport-enabler) and integrates its providers into Kvaesitso's location search.

## Usage

Download the .apk from the release page of this repository and enable it in the plugin settings. Then, go to the settings of the plugin (gears on the top right) when you have opened the settings of the plugin. Now, select the providers you want to get search results for. Note that if you activate multiple providers whose regions overlap, you might get duplicate results. Then, go back to your homescreen and start searching! (Make sure you have location search enabled in your filterbar and Kvaesitso has location permissions.)

## Providers

Currently, all providers of [schildbach/public-transport-enabler](https://github.com/schildbach/public-transport-enabler) that do _not_ require an API key are accessible through this plugin. Generally, if you miss one for your area, check [schildbach/public-transport-enabler](https://github.com/schildbach/public-transport-enabler) whether or not it is available there, and if it is, whether or not it requires an API key. As of right now, there is no support for providers that require an API key.

## Roadmap

This is a list of things that are TODO:

- [ ] Add support for Providers that require an API key
- [ ] Add icons to location attribution
- [ ] Redesign settings screen (sometime)
