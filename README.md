# Public transport plugin for Kvaesitso

This plugin enables querying your local public transport providers for stops and departures near you, while using your favorite launcher app [Kvaesitso](https://github.com/MM2-0/Kvaesitso).
It is a thin wrapper around [schildbach/public-transport-enabler](https://github.com/schildbach/public-transport-enabler) and integrates its providers into Kvaesitso's location search.

## Translation

## Providers

Currently, all providers of [schildbach/public-transport-enabler](https://github.com/schildbach/public-transport-enabler) that do _not_ require an API key are accessible through this plugin. Generally, if you miss one for your area, check [schildbach/public-transport-enabler](https://github.com/schildbach/public-transport-enabler) whether or not it is available there, and if it is, whether or not it requires an API key. As of right now, there is no support for providers that require an API key.

## Roadmap

This is a list of things that are TODO:

- [ ] Add support for Providers that require an API key
- [ ] Add icons to location attribution
- [ ] Redesign settings screen (sometime)
